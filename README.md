### Decsription:

Made as a final project to CS50
I was clueless on what to do for the CS50 project. Where do people go to get some idea..Yes by googling it..I  stumbled upon <https://www.crio.do/projects/category/web-development-projects> then i chose to go with SORTING VISUALISER.

Why sorting Visualizer? :

Data structures and algorithms part of CS50 course was a challenging task for me.I was really happy when i was able solve the problem set for that week. In the week 3 algorithms chapter, I got to know about sorting algorithms like bubble sort,selection sort,merge sort, etc..That's when i realised how important it is to sort data in an efficient manner. So, when i thought about a project to do... I thought why don't i implement those algorithms.It would help me deep dive into the world of algorithms and it would help me understand the logic behind those algorithms.I considered it as a learning opportunity and went on with the project

Bubble sort,selection sort,insertion sort were realtively simple to implement.But Quick and Merge were challenging.The real challenge was to make the sorts visualize in a way that that others can comprehend what is happening with each sort. Along with understanding how to implemant the algorithms.I also got introduced to async, await functionalities of javascript.I had my fair share of struggles.But i am happy that finally,i was able to complete it.

The project showcases 6 buttons and 2 sliders
1) New Array: Creates new array with random numbers each time
2) Buttons to visualize each sorts
3) Slider for resizing the array
4) Slider for changing the speed of sort

I have also added colors on distince steps of sorting so that people can easily comprehend whats happening with each sort.I have disabled other sort buttons.resize-slider to eliminate conflicts

####Bubble Sort:
Conceptually bubble-sort was relatively easier to understand.The process checks for the largest element of rest of the array and bubble it outward.
The challenge was to implement the how to visualize the sort.I ended up giving sorted elements green color and for the un-sorted white. To emphasis that the sorting is going on i added red color as a way to visualize searching through the array for the largest element.

####Selection Sort:
selection sort was more or like a bubble sort in reverse.The code was searching for the lowest element in remaining array and push it to the front.i

####Insertion Sort:


####Quick Sort:


####Merge Sort:


I hope to implement notes on each algorithms in the website itself so that people can more info about each sorting algorithms in the website itself. I have hosted the website on github. And i will be updating it.
