PS - working on array-resizing and speed sliders.

# finalProjectCS50
Made as a final project to CS50
I was clueless on what to do for the CS50 project. Where do people go to get some idea..Yes by googling it..I  stumbled upon "https://www.crio.do/projects/category/web-development-projects" then i chose to go with SORTING VISUALISER as it complements the skills that i already have."https://www.crio.do/projects/javascript-sorting-visualiser/"

WHY SORTING VISUALISER? :
Data structures and algorithPS-working on merge-sort.....ms part of CS50 course was a challenging task for me.I was really happy when i was able solve the problem set for that week. In the week 3 algorithms chapter, I got to know about sorting algorithms like bubble sort,selection sort,merge sort, etc..That's when i realised how important it is to sort data in an efficient manner. So, when i thought about a project to do... I thought why don't i implement those algorithms.It would help me deep dive into the world of algorithms and it would help me understand the logic behind those algorithms.I considered it as a learning opportunity and went on with the project

Bubble sort,selection sort,insertion sort were realtively simple to implement.But Quick and Merge were challenging.The real challenge was to make the sorts visualize in a way that that others can comprehend what is happening with each sort.I had my fair share of struggles.But i am happy that finally,i was able to complete it.

The project showcases 6 buttons and 2 sliders
1) New Array: Creates new array with random numbers each time
2) buttons to visualize each sorts
3)slider for resizing the array
4)slider for changing the speed of sort

I hope to implement notes on each algorithms in the website itself so that people can more info about each sorting algorithms in the website itself. I have hosted the website on github. And i will be updating it.

Along with understanding how to implemant the alorithms.I also got introduced to async, await functionalities of javascript.
